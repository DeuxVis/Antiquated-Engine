Archaic Engine
--------------
Old windows C/C++ game framework and legacy DX9 graphics engine

The code contained here was generated over many years as part of various hobby projects largely centered around the game 'The Universal', which was a never-quite-good-enough attempt at making a distributed MMO in the early 2000s.  

It is not well designed, well implemented, well structured or well.. anything but it is what it is.  Considering that most of it was written very late at night, often after a few beers, its always surprising any of it works at all.

This project has mostly been created for the sake of posterity rather than any expectation of practical value.

Overall structure of the repo
-----------------------------
The repo consists of two main blocks of code that reflect different coding periods:
1) 'Pub' :
2) Everything else : largely stems from a brief stint around 2016-2017 spent trying to form a set of generic C++ game components that could be used in new projects.
